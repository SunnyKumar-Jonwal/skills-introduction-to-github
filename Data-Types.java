1. What Is Data Type?

-> Data Type Is A Classification Of Data That Specifies The Type Of Data That Can Be Stored In A Variable.

-> Data Types Are Used To Specify The Type Of Data That Can Be Stored In A Variable.

-> Data Types Are Used To Specify The Type Of Data That Can Be Stored In A Variable.

-> In Java, There Are Two Types Of Data Types:
-> Primitive Data Types
-> Non-Primitive Data Types

2. What Is Primitive Data Type?

-> Primitive Data Types Are The Most Basic Data Types In Java.

-> Primitive Data Types Are Given Below:
-> byte : 8-bit signed integer, range: -128 to 127, Used to save memory in large arrays.

-> short : 16-bit signed integer, range: -32,768 to 32,767, Used to save memory in large arrays.

-> int : 32-bit signed integer, range: -2^31 to 2^31-1, Used to save memory in large arrays.

-> long : 64-bit signed integer, range: -2^63 to 2^63-1, Used to save memory in large arrays.

-> float : 32-bit floating point, range: -3.40282347E+38 to 3.40282347E+38, Used to save memory in large arrays.

-> double : 64-bit floating point, range: -1.79769313486231570E+308 to 1.79769313486231570E+308, Used to save memory in large arrays.

-> char : 16-bit Unicode character, range: '\u0000' to '\uffff', Used to save memory in large arrays.

-> boolean : 1-bit boolean value, range: true or false, Used to save memory in large arrays.

2. What Is Non-Primitive Data Type?

-> Non-Primitive Data Types Are The Most Basic Data Types In Java.

-> Non-Primitive Data Types Are Given Below:

-> String : A sequence of characters, range: any character, Used to save memory in large arrays.

-> Array : A collection of elements of the same type, range: any element, Used to save memory in large arrays.

-> List : A collection of elements of the same type, range: any element, Used to save memory in large arrays.

-> Set : A collection of elements of the same type, range: any element, Used to save memory in large arrays.

-> Stack : A collection of elements of the same type, range: any element, Used to save memory in large arrays.
